# config/firms.yaml
# V1 philosophy: high precision > high recall.
# - NO single-word aliases (e.g., "Jump", "Jane", "HRT")
# - NO acronyms unless they are unambiguous (in practice, almost none are)
# - Prefer official-ish names and common long forms only
# - People/person mentions handled later (separate config)

# NOTE: ADD REDDIT-ONLY ALIASES LIKE JS
